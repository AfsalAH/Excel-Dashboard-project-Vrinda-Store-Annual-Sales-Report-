# Excel-Dashboard-project-Vrinda-Store-Annual-Sales-Report-

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Vrinda Store's sales report üè¨ to understand customer preferences and boost sales for the upcoming year üìà.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Extraction**: The data was extracted from an Excel (.xlsx) file.
2. **Data Cleansing**: Ensured data consistency by removing duplicates, null values, and converting 'M' into 'Men' and 'W' into 'Women'.
3. **Data Enrichment**: Added 'Age Group' and 'Month' columns.
4. **Data Analysis**: Used Pivot Tables to reveal sales patterns, trends, and order channels.

## Dashboard Design
The Excel dashboard incorporates pivot tables, static tables, dynamic charts, auto-shapes, gauge widgets, and other non-chart elements to ensure a clear and readable dashboard.

## Key Insights
- The highest sales month was March.
- Women accounted for 64% of sales.
- The 30-49 age group made up about 50% of purchases.
- Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra were the primary sales channels.
- The top-performing states for 2022 were Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.

## Conclusion
To improve sales, the store should:
- Target female customers aged 30-49 in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh with ads, coupons, discounts, and value-added services on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.
- Analyze and address order cancellations, refunds, and return requests to enhance customer satisfaction.
